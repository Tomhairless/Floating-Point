This is repo about a new Floating point implemented along with the systolic array on both FPGAs and ASICs for accelerating AI. 

Test Results can be found at FP_TEST_RESULT
The Python Implementation can be found at the folder github -> OPENCODE
The comparison result with IEEE754 and X86 and the area (ulitilization) comparison are in the github folder. 

ASIC implementation constrains are in the FP_ASIC folder, including sdc file, sdf file and 2 report from DC with 28nm technology. 

This project is originally created by my PhD student, Haotian Liu (Tuyouka) and I folk this project for presenting the current result for my NIA project.
